I had the pleasure of working with Alona on several AI projects. She always demonstrated a very high level of commitment and motivation and also showed a great comprehension of new technical topics that were thrown at her, whether it was LLMs, RAG, Machine Learning Engineering or Software Engineering related. She is able to cover a broad range of IT topics due to her ability to maintain highest Software Engineering standards while having a great understanding of Machine Learning. Overall she will be a great contributor to any AI-oriented mission.
