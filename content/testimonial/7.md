I had the pleasure of working with Alona in my department Data Science & AI, and I can confidently say that she is an exceptional professional. Alona's technical abilities are truly impressive, and she consistently demonstrated a high level of expertise in her work. Her motivation for additional efforts and engagements was evident in every project she undertook, always aiming to go above and beyond to ensure success. Alona is a dedicated and talented individual who would be a valuable asset to any AI projects.
