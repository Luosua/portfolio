I had the privilege of working alongside Alona on a webinar focused on Generative AI (GenAI) and Responsible AI (RAI), and I am delighted to recommend her wholeheartedly.

Alona is a true expert in the fields of Generative AI and Responsible AI. Her deep knowledge and practical experience were instrumental in shaping the content of our webinar, ensuring it was both insightful and impactful for our audience.

Beyond her technical expertise, she is highly effective and well-organized. Her ability to handle complex tasks with ease and professionalism is truly commendable.

I particularly enjoyed working with her, because of her friendly and approachable nature. She fosters a collaborative and positive working environment, while keeping an eye on the goal and the success of the team.

I am confident that Alona will be a great addition to your team. I look forward to seeing all the great things she will achieve in the future.
