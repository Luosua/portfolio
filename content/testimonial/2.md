It was a great pleasure to work with Alona on a range of Generative AI topics. Her contributions to the CBTW Natural Language Processing community (Retrieval Augmented Generation best practices, Responsible AI perspectives, and Real-World Use Cases) were highly valuable, clearly communicated, and she proactively pushed forward innovative ideas.

Above all, she did an excellent job developing a cloud-hosted multi-turn dialog chatbot that can integrate information from relational data sources and unstructured documents and sets an example for automated content moderation filtering best practices to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI tools.

While having strong foundations in Data Science Alona took a multi-disciplinary perspective by attending the XAI, RAI, CV, and NLP communities and actively developed Responsible AI initiatives across Data Science projects. She has proven to be a strong collaborator in organizing Webinars like the Responsible AI Webinar or contributing to team efforts like the internal Hackathons and ideation sessions.
