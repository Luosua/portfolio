In modern robotics, efficiency and adaptability are key to automating complex tasks, especially in manufacturing and logistics. My mission was to develop intelligent robotic systems that could perceive, learn and act autonomously, leveraging reinforcement learning, synthetic data and real-time inference.

To train AI models for robotic object picking, I designed and generated synthetic training data, creating artificial 3D environments that simulated real-world tasks. This approach eliminated the need for expensive real-world data collection, making the system scalable and highly adaptable.

The real challenge, however, lay in optimizing motion planningâ€”ensuring the robot could pick objects quickly, accurately and in dynamic environments. By applying reinforcement learning, I trained the system to adapt its movements based on feedback, enhancing both efficiency and decision-making.

This project combined my expertise in computer vision, reinforcement learning and machine learning, demonstrating how AI can enhance real-world automation. By integrating synthetic data and adaptive learning, I built a solution that made robotics smarter, faster and more efficient, setting the stage for the next generation of intelligent automation.
