In today's fast-paced business environments, communication workflows often rely on multiple data formats, including text and images. To address this challenge, I enriched a chatbot solution with an image ingestion pipeline that allowed the chatbot to analyze and integrate visual data into its knowledge base. This breakthrough enabled users to ask questions not only about textual content but also about images, making multimodal question answering a reality.

Beyond the chatbot's ability to process and retrieve visual data, I also developed Outlook and Microsoft Teams connectors, enabling flawless integration with enterprise communication workflows and making the chatbot more customizable and accessible to users by allowing them to interact with it directly within familiar tools. This integration streamlined workflows, reduced friction in information retrieval and enabled organizations to tailor the chatbotâ€™s responses and capabilities to their specific needs.

To ensure transparency and trust in the system, I applied Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, giving users visibility into how image processing workflows and retrieval mechanisms function. This ensured that every chatbot response based on visual data was traceable and verifiable, reinforcing reliability.
