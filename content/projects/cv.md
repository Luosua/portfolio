In the world of financial services, ensuring compliance while providing a seamless user experience is a delicate balance. The Know Your Customer (KYC) process, a critical requirement for bank account openings, often suffers from manual inefficiencies and fraud risks. My goal was to automate and optimize KYC verification, leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision.

I led the development of an AI-driven KYC solution, which streamlined identity verification, ensuring that customers could onboard faster, safer and smoother. A major milestone was improving the recognition accuracy of German ID security features by 60%, thanks to advanced deep learning models and computer vision techniques.

This project highlighted my ability to bridge AI innovation with real-world business challenges, applying expertise in machine learning, neural networks and advanced data analysis to build a highly effective, fraud-resistant KYC automation system. By combining technical excellence with a deep understanding of financial security needs, I helped financial institutions enhance trust, security and efficiency in their customer verification processes.
