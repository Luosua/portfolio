Fraud detection in banking is a high-stakes challenge, where every false positive disrupts legitimate customers, and every false negative costs millions. My mission was to enhance fraud prevention while simplifying complexity—turning an unmanageable 10 million model setup into a highly efficient 9-model solution.

The breakthrough came from an optimized customer segmentation strategy, which allowed us to dramatically reduce the number of required models without compromising predictive accuracy. This streamlined model training, deployment and evaluation, making fraud prevention scalable and cost-effective.

Beyond segmentation, I enhanced the existing XGBoost model performance by engineering new, highly predictive features, improving fraud detection accuracy while minimizing unnecessary transaction rejections. To further elevate anomaly detection, I implemented an autoencoder-based strategy for transaction evaluation, introducing an additional layer of unsupervised fraud detection that identified subtle, previously undetectable fraud patterns.
By applying machine learning, clustering, and graph-based approaches, I delivered a powerful, efficient, and production-ready fraud prevention system that banks could trust.

The result? A smarter, faster and scalable AI-driven fraud prevention solution, showcasing how strategic ML optimization can turn an overwhelming problem into an elegant, high-impact solution.
