## Homepage about

  translation: "Who am I?"

- id: "about_content"
  translation:  <p class="lead">
      As an AI developer with over 5 years of experience, I am fascinated by the transformative potential
      of artificial intelligence to improve lives and drive groundbreaking innovations that shape the future.
      With extensive experience in Generative AI (GenAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP),
      I specialize in designing scalable, user-centric solutions — from retrieval-augmented chatbots to
      fraud prevention systems. My passion lies in applying Responsible and Explainable AI (RAI & XAI)
       to ensure transparency, trust and ethical AI deployment.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      Beyond technical expertise, I am committed to clear communication, reliability and flexibility—principles
       that not only drive the development of high-quality AI systems but also foster strong, trust-based
       relationships with clients. Reliability ensures both the technical excellence of my solutions and the
       trust that clients can place in my work. Clear communication streamlines collaboration, saving time for
        all parties and accelerating the creation of successful AI products. Flexibility allows me to adapt
        solutions to evolving client needs while continuously learning and integrating cutting-edge technologies
         to ensure that every AI system I build is both state-of-the-art and tailored to its specific use case.
          My approach combines business-driven AI development with cutting-edge research, ensuring that
           each solution is both technologically advanced and impactful in the real world.</p>
    <p class="lead">
    What I find most rewarding is seeing AI solutions I develop drive real impact—whether by streamlining
    KYC processes, improving customer support automation or enhancing efficiency in industrial workflows.
    I believe adaptability is key; by staying receptive to client needs and continuously refining solutions,
     I ensure that every AI project I undertake is not just technically sophisticated, but also practical,
     scalable and transformative.</p>
